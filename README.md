# Real-Time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## Project Overview

This project implements a state-of-the-art, microservices-based Real-Time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It demonstrates proficiency in distributed systems, data engineering, machine learning, and modern software development practices.

### Key Features

- Microservices architecture
- Real-time data processing
- Scalable and maintainable design
- Integration of multiple cutting-edge technologies

## System Architecture

The system is composed of the following microservices:

1. **Data Crawling**
2. **Data Ingestion**
3. **Preprocessing**
4. **Vector-Storing**
5. **RAG Engine**

Each microservice is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, showcasing expertise in containerization and microservices deployment.

## Microservices Breakdown

- **Functionality**: Fetches data from various sources (LinkedIn, Wikipedia, etc.)
- **Technologies**: Web scraping libraries, API integrations
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Data acquisition, API usage, web scraping techniques

### 2. Data Ingestion

- **Functionality**: Stores crawled data in MongoDB and implements Change Data Capture (CDC)
- **Technologies**: MongoDB, Kafka
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Database management, real-time data streaming, event-driven architecture

### 3. Preprocessing

- **Functionality**: Consumes Kafka messages, performs data transformation and preprocessing
- **Technologies**: Apache Spark, Kafka
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Big data processing, distributed computing, data transformation techniques

### 4. Vector-Storing

- **Functionality**: Consumes processed data from Kafka and stores vector embeddings
- **Technologies**: Qdrant (vector database), Kafka
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Vector databases, data persistency in AI systems

### 5. RAG Engine

- **Functionality**: Implements core RAG functionality (retrieval, generation, etc.)
- **Technologies**: Latest NLP models, vector similarity search
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval

## Technical Highlights

- **Distributed Systems**: Microservices communicating via Kafka demonstrate understanding of distributed system design.
